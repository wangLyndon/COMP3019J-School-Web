# School Management System

## Overview

This project represents a significant update to a **School Management System**, which is built using **Python Flask** for backend development and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend. The system is designed to streamline various administrative tasks within a school, enhance interaction among students, teachers, and administrators, and provide a comprehensive restaurant management feature.

The system defines four primary user roles, each with specific permissions and functionalities:

- **Students:** Students can register for or drop courses, view course announcements, browse the restaurant menu, and post reviews. Additionally, students can access other users' reviews to help inform their choices.
- **Teachers:** Teachers are responsible for creating courses, publishing announcements, managing enrolled students (including removing students), and interacting with the restaurant menu and reviews.
- **Restaurant Management Personnel:** They manage the restaurant menu, including creating and maintaining it, and can review user feedback on the menu and services.
- **Administrators:** With the highest level of access, administrators manage user permissions, view system logs, and perform all database operations.

One of the system's key highlights is the integration of **ChatGPT**, providing intelligent assistance for all user roles. Students can query course information, teachers and restaurant personnel can analyze feedback effectively, and administrators can perform complex queries and manage tasks efficiently.

The development of this project focuses on fulfilling the daily teaching and management needs of the school while ensuring efficiency, reliability, and scalability through modular design and role-based functionalities.
